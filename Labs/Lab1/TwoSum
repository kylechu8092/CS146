My approach was storing values and indexes in key value pairs in a HashMap.
We will iterate through the list of numbers, calculate the complement, which is target - nums[i]
We would then check if the complement is a key in the hashmap, if not we will put the nums[i] and index into the hashmap
We will use a hashmap because we can quickly grab a value and it's index. We will calculate the complement of the value
we are iterating over and utilize the hashmap quick access to check if the complement exists in the hashmap, meaning 
we have iterated over a complement and added it to the hashmap.
