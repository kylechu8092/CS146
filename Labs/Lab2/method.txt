The most effective way to determine an anagram is to determine if they have a matching character set.
To do this, we will make a helper method to convert a string into a hashmap with character as the key
and the number of iterations each character has as its value. We will generate two of these hashmaps,
which if they are anagrams of each other, should be equal.
