The approach to the problem is using dfs. In this case, we can use dfs with recursion and based on how we want to access each val.
In the question, we want to access each node in 4 directions, so up, down, left and right. We recursively change the 
values of the row and col to do this, checking the bounds and the conditions of the color we are accessing. We make sure
that the each new pixel we access matches the starting color value and make sure the bounds are correct.
