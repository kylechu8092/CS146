Queston has intervals. We can interpret these intervals as start and end points. We will update our server count depending on
what is happening during these intervals. Lets say for the test case, meeting 0 to 30. Theres another meeting that
is going to happen in 5 to 10. We can sort both start and ending intervals into 2 arrays. First we are going to check
if start[0] < end[0]. We can see that the 0 < 10, so we will increase our server count. We are essentially, looking at 
every point in time to see if a server is needed. Since we finished at 0, we are going to check again at the 
next starting time which is at 5. We again, are going to be needing another server because the at start time 5, 2 meetings 
will be going on at the same time.
