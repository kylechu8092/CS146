In order to sovle this, I thought to use two pointers. Once we remove all spaces, commas, etc, and lowercase
we will use two pointers, one at the beginning and one at the end. The moment the two pointers don't have a value in 
common we will return false. One trick to keep all the alpha numeric is the expression [^0-9a-zA-Z], which essentially
will check whether or not a character is either 0-9,a-z,A-Z. The ^ is used as a negation symbol, so replacing all values 
that are NOT 0-9,a-z,A-Z will be exactly what we want.
