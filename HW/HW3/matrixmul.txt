MATRIX_MULTIPLY(A, B): 
  if columns(A) ≠ rows(B): 
    raise ValueError("Matrix multiplication is not defined.") 

  rows_A ← number of rows in A 
  cols_A ← number of columns in A 
  cols_B ← number of columns in B 
  result ← matrix of size rows_A x cols_B filled with zeros 

  for i from 1 to rows_A do: 
    for j from 1 to cols_B do: 
    sum ← 0  
      for k from 1 to cols_A do: 
        sum ← sum + A[i][k] * B[k][j] 
      result[i][j] ← sum return result

The first lines of code are constants
We can look at the first for loop
  for i from 1 to rows_A do: N+1
      for j from 1 to cols_B do: N(N+1)
        for k from 1 to cols_A do: N^2(N+1)

We will find that the f(n) = n^2(n+1) = O(n^3) = Omega(n^3) = Theta(n^3)
