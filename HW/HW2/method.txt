This problem sounds like binary search, where we can determine bounds based on the value of the position.
In this case, we are using the helper method to determine how to adjust our bounds, 
if the method tells us that the middle is bad, we will have to adjust our right bound, if middle is good adjust left bound, and if the middle is bad
and the middle-1 is good, then we have found the version we want to return.
