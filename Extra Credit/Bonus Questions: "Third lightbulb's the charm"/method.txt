The method to do this in O(n) is using a for loop, not recursively.
The sequence can be determined by the rule that its nth value is calculated by n-1 + n-2
We can do it O(n) by keeping track of the previous values. We first calculate the val by adding left and right
which are the two pointers tailing behind. Then we update the two pointers, the left is now right, and the right is now val.
We will keep adding until i reaches n and return val.
